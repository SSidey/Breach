//! The fight's melee blows in the scrum (ScrumBlows.blows' search) and the landing's
//! counts (BlowLanding._pressed) on the field's own state, as of a sync of the scrum's
//! snapshot made for them. Every unit of a squad that strikes picks the foe it touches -
//! one in its front first, then the nearest, then by the seeded draw (ScrumBlows._pick,
//! the least by the full key, which never ties, so the grid's visiting order can't
//! matter) - and is told whether its blow would come from the foe's flank and whether it
//! has turned away from it while retreating. Cooldowns, the morale's interval and the blow
//! itself stay GDScript's (ScrumBlowsField), taken in the same order.
