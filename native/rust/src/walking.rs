//! The scrum's walk (FormationScrum._walk) on the field's own state. Each fighting unit
//! steps once a tick: one making for a slot towards its next point (the plan's AIM and
//! PRESS), one with no slot that touches no foe (STAND, IDLE) back towards its place in its squad's frame (SquadFrame.place, with
//! ScrumStance's anchor), looking where UnitShuffle says. Either steps round the nearest
//! body in its way that won't part for it (UnitSteer), at the pace its bearing allows
//! (UnitMotion.move), slowed by the bodies lying underfoot (GroundBodies.underfoot). The
//! steps are the GDScript reference's, bit for bit: the same maths in the same precision
//! (`maths`, `motion`, DetMath's asin, sin and cos), the body stepped round the least by
//! the full key [distance along, draw], which never ties, and the footing a least over the
//! bodies lying near, so the grids' visiting order can't matter. Every unit reads the
//! bodies as they stood before any stepped (the scrum's snapshot), so the walk's own
//! order can't either.
