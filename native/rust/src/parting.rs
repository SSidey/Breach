//! The body-parting pass of `sim/skirmish/formation/unit_bodies.gd`, over plain arrays
//! (BodyField gathers them from its own state, in the bodies' draw order).
//!
//! Every operation mirrors the GDScript path's precision and order, so results are bit for
//! bit the same: `Vector2` maths in f32 (Godot's `real_t`), GDScript `float`s in f64, a
//! `Vector2 * float` narrowing the float to f32 first, the same summation order, no fused
//! multiply-add (Rust never contracts `a * b + c` on its own).
