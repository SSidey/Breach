//! The scrum's facing (FormationScrum._faces and the turns after it) on the field's own
//! state. Each fighting unit turns once a tick, at its turn rate, towards the foe it
//! touches - one in its front first, then the nearest, then by the seeded draw
//! (ScrumBlows._pick) - or else so as to arrive facing what it will do: the foe at the
//! slot it makes for (UnitShuffle.look), or the point its walk chose (`toward`). The
//! choices and bearings are the GDScript reference's, bit for bit: the same maths in the
//! same precision (`motion`, `det_math`), and the touching foe the least by the full key
//! [front, distance, draw], which never ties, so the grid's visiting order can't matter.
