extends ItemDef
## What a unit fights with (Decision 47): a unit's damage comes from its weapons, not from
## stats on the creature. Melee weapons (range 0) are used together when the unit is in
## the front rank of a fight; a ranged weapon is used from further back. The attack
## profile Decision 34 says units and emplacements share. A weapon is an item (ItemDef:
## slots, weight, tags, traits). See specs/07-data-resource-schemas.md.

## The least share of its damage a blow deals before its wielder's skill lifts it toward
## the full (Decision 119): a club varies more than a spear.

## 119): a maul much, a dagger little.

## Whether its blows are magic (Decision 119): ward, not armour, stands against them.
## Magic is a source, not a type - fire and magic fire are both fire; arcane is magic with
## no element.

## Seconds between its blows (Decision 120): an unwieldy weapon strikes more slowly. The
## wielder's attack speed scales it.

## A natural melee weapon striking for `damage` (Decision 120): what a unit fights
## with when it carries nothing else.
