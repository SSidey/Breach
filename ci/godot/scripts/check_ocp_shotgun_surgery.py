"""ocp-shotgun-surgery, per AI_First_Development_Kit/principles/solid-mechanical.md (O)
and config/thresholds.yaml (solid_mechanical.ocp.max_touched_files_per_new_case).

Ported from https://github.com/SSidey/Sweepminer's dev_kit/ci/godot/scripts/
check_ocp_shotgun_surgery.py (same kit, same gap - originally marked "no known static
tool" in this repo's own ci/godot/README.md; Sweepminer's diff-scoped approach is a
real, simple mechanical implementation of the rubric's literal definition).

Counts pre-existing .gd files modified (not added) in this branch vs. a base ref.

Honest limit: this counts *modified* pre-existing files - it cannot distinguish "one
new case forced N files open" from any other reason N files changed together (e.g. a
deliberate, justified refactor). A genuine exception should be recorded as a Decision
(AI_First_Development_Kit/principles/decision-ledger.md), not silently ignored.

Only meaningful with a real base ref to diff against (a PR's merge-base) - not run as
part of the working-tree-only pre-commit gate, only in CI where that ref exists.
