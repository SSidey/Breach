class_name WaveFormPanel
extends Control
## Player input for forming a marching wave, per specs/08-composition-root-and-input.md.
## Grem are bought instantly (no "in production" state exists in this slice), so
## "filled" for this map's wave command just means "at least one unit was queued" -
## the CommandQueue latch (Decision 3) still applies, delaying the actual march to the
## next tick boundary, not the buying.
##
## max_pending_units (found necessary via manual playtest - queueing was unbounded)
## is a temporary stopgap for the formation-grid system (Phase 4 item 6, deferred
## pending its own design pass), using the same "3 slots" starting shape the plan
## already commits to rather than a number invented here.
