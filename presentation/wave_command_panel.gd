class_name WaveCommandPanel
extends Control
## Live wave-command status, per specs/05-presentation-and-hud.md. Shows
## pending/committed status only, not a numeric "X/Y filled" count - see this
## project's Notes for why (CommandQueue's is_filled_check is a boolean predicate by
## design, with no numeric progress source to read from yet; nothing in this slice's
## content authors a "wave size" for that count to be measured against either).
## Revisit once real wave-forming content exists to drive it.
