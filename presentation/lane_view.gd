class_name LaneView
extends Node2D
## Renders the lane and interpolates unit positions between tick boundaries
## (Decision 1), per specs/05-presentation-and-hud.md. Read-only: only ever reads
## simulation state via `lane`'s query methods; never mutates simulation state.
##
## Self-subscribes to SimEvents.tick_advanced in _ready() - unlike sim/'s RefCounted
## components, a Node's scene-tree lifecycle handles connection/disconnection
## automatically (Godot disconnects a Node's signal connections when it exits the
## tree), so the reference-lifetime concern that ruled out self-subscription for
## sim/ classes doesn't apply here.
##
## Scoped to this slice's actual content shape - at most one player wave and one
## moving blocker (Hero Party) at a time, per specs/00's scripted scenario - tracked
## as two named positions rather than a generic multi-entity id scheme. A future map
## with simultaneous waves would need LaneSimulation to hand out stable per-entity
## ids first; not built ahead of that real need.
##
## Honest test-coverage note (see specs/05's own Notes): TickInterpolation's pure
## math is unit-tested headlessly (tests/presentation/test_tick_interpolation.gd).
## This class's actual rendering has no automated coverage - it needs a real render
## context, which only exists once a running scene is assembled (Phase 3 item 11).
## Manual playtest verifies it there.
##
## speed_multiplier (found necessary via manual playtest) scales
## _elapsed_since_last_tick's own accumulation the same way SimulationClock scales
## its internal elapsed counter - without this, the unit's on-screen animation filled
## at the old 1x pace while the real tick fired early at 2x/4x, cutting the animation
## short (visibly stopping halfway at 2x, a quarter of the way at 4x) instead of
## finishing right as the tick advanced.
