class_name SquadFrame
extends RefCounted
## A squad's frame in cells (Decisions 74 and 105, specs/27-formations-in-2d.md and
## 30-continuous-positioning.md): its position is the centre of its front edge, and it
## faces a heading (degrees clockwise from north), or one of four ways for what still
## reckons in those. A unit's (rank, column) is turned to it, never mirrored, so the squad's
## left stays its left. Screen convention: x east, y south. Facings run clockwise. Pure.

const NORTH := 0
const EAST := 1
const SOUTH := 2

## The corners of a unit's footprint in a frame at `anchor` turned to `heading` (degrees):
## its columns from the squad's left (centred on the front centre, moved by centre_shift),
## its ranks back from the front.

## The cells a unit's footprint spans in a frame turned to `heading`: the box round its
## corners (on a quarter heading, the footprint itself).

## The centre of a unit's place in a frame at `anchor` turned to `heading` (degrees): its
## columns from the squad's left (centred on the front centre, moved by centre_shift), its
## ranks back from the front.

## The world axis a squad's columns run along at `heading`: its right hand, turned to
## point east of north-south (or south, facing east or west), so two squads across one axis
## measure their spans the same way round.

	return UnitMotion.vector(fposmod(heading, 180.0) + 90.0)


## How far `points` reach along `axis`: (least, most).

	var reach := Vector2(INF, -INF)
	for point in points:
		var along := point.dot(axis)
		reach = Vector2(minf(reach.x, along), maxf(reach.y, along))
