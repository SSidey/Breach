## The fallen (specs/22-formation-feel-test.md, Decisions 47, 82 and 121): a unit brought to
## 0 hp is downed - its hp stops at 0, the excess lost, and it lies where it fell - unless
## the blows took it past minus its constitution, which kills it outright. Either way it
## leaves the fight and shakes its squad, the ranks behind step up (units find the fight
## themselves: Decision 88), and a squad with no one left is destroyed, freeing whoever
## fought it. What becomes of the downed is FormationWounds'. Pure over the squads.
