## Trading places while regrouping (Decision 110): a unit walking back to its place that has
## come no nearer than its closest for scrum_trade_seconds - its own ranks in the way - trades
## places with the friend whose place is nearest it, if that place is nearer it than its
## own and the two are interchangeable (one kind, one band); the friend walks to the place
## it left. With no such friend, its own place is the nearest: it takes it. Places stay one
## unit each. Stalled units trade in the order of their seeded draws, never the list's
## (Decision 97). Pure over the squad it is given.
