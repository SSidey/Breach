class_name FormationWalk
extends RefCounted
## Units walk to their places (spec 30 round 3, part 2): a formation's frame is a set of
## places, not positions. Every unit in its place - not loose in a fight, nor fleeing -
## walks to it each tick at its own pace on the ground it crosses, as loose units do: a
## wheel's outer file walks the arc, a re-form walks, a unit pushed aside walks back. Far
## from its place it faces where it walks; near it, its formation's way, stepping sideways
## or back. The frame keeps within a slack of its units (share): it slows as a unit lags
## towards what its formation's discipline allows (walk_slack_drilled to walk_slack_loose)
## and waits beyond it, unless that unit has fallen behind (walk_lost) - then only "no man
## left behind" waits for it; under "fall behind, left behind" it never waits. Placing a
## squad sets its units on their places (FormationMarch.sync_units). Pure.
