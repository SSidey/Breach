extends RefCounted
## Turning as a re-form (Decision 92, spec 27 round 6): a squad that must face another way
## where it stands - going back the way it faces, or re-forming after a withdrawal or a
## pursuit - takes its new heading at once, an about-face reversing its ranks, and its units
## walk from where they stand to their new places at its re-form pace
## (FormationDiscipline). It moves on once they are all in place, so a disciplined squad
## turns quickly and a ragged one slowly. Pure.

## Re-faces the squad where it stands before it moves `travel_sign` along its route: an
## about-face first if it must go back the way it faces, then its frame turned to its
## route's heading there. True if it turned; its units then re-form before it moves. (On
## the march a squad doesn't come here for a bend: its frame sweeps round it, FormationSweep.)
