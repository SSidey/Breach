## Finding what is near a point without looking at everything (spec 30 round 3): points -
## bodies, slots, claims - bucketed by square cells CELL across, built once for a snapshot.
## A query gives the indices of every point in the cells it could reach, in the order the
## points were given, so a search over them keeps the list's order wherever it would have
## (a superset of what qualifies, never a different order: outcomes stay the same, Decision
## 97). Searches outward go ring by ring of cells, each no nearer than the one before.
## Pure; cells.

## Cells a bucket spans: about the widest body, so a touch is a neighbouring bucket away.
