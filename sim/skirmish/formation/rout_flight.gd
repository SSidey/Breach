class_name RoutFlight
extends RefCounted
## How a disorderly flight spreads (Decision 99, spec 27 round 10): a fleeing unit makes for
## the nearest safety. With a standing friendly formation between it and home (its
## refuge), it steers for that friend, which catches it (RoutCatch). Otherwise a rout's
## units don't keep to their route's line but fan out from it, each by its own angle -
## seeded by the battle and the unit - up to rout_fan_degrees either side, until
## rout_fan_cells out (BattleTuning) or the ground to the side can't be crossed. A ragged
## retreat fans out by its disorder (FormationWithdraw). Pure.
