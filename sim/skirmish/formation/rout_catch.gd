class_name RoutCatch
extends RefCounted
## Which friendly formation catches a router (Decisions 82, 89 and 98; spec 27 round 11):
## any standing friend a router has run into and got behind - the friend now between it and
## the enemy - holds it, wherever it then steps to, until it joins that formation (its rear)
## or the formation itself routs; the nearest friend catches, not the first
## listed, a tie going to the friends' units' seeded draws (Decision 97). Pure.
