extends RefCounted
## A formation pursuing as a whole (Decision 95, spec 27 round 8): when its enemy retreats
## it stays locked on it and its frame advances after it as a body, along the route its
## quarry flees by (Decision 113: a route is a way to travel, not the formation's own) - no
## faster than its rearmost unit keeps up (Decision 103) - its units seeking contact as
## they go at the march pace. When the enemy is out of its sight, gone, or no longer
## retreating, or it has gone as far from its post as its discipline leashes it
## (FormationDiscipline.pursuit_leash, Decision 107), it gives up: it marches back along the
## route it is on to the post it held, takes up its own route there and turns to face the
## way it held it, taking up its order again. Squads keep `pursuit` ({"foe", "route",
## "post", "post_at", "home", "direction", "order", "returning"}). Pure over the squads.
