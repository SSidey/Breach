class_name GroupSplit
extends RefCounted
## A group's units fallen behind go on as a group of their own (spec 30 round 3, part 4):
## a cluster of the group's units (each within group_join of another) cut off from the
## rest, all further from their places than walk_lost - the frame no longer waits for them
## (FormationWalk), unless no man is left behind - splits off as a group. Each new group
## follows the same command and orders, along the same route, its front where its foremost
## unit stands;
## its units line up across it by where they stand. New groups are numbered in the order
## of their units' seeded draws, never by ids or lists (Decision 97). Pure.
