extends RefCounted
## Regrouping after a fight (Decisions 88 and 92, spec 27 rounds 5 and 6): units of squads
## out of the fight walk back to their places - in the squad's stance, if it holds one - at
## its re-form pace (FormationDiscipline), and rejoin its frame once in place and facing its
## way; one held off its place trades places or takes it (ScrumTrade, Decision 110). A
## drilled retreat's units back away facing the foe they touch (a fighting withdrawal,
## Decision 95). Every squad's units face the foes they touched as the phase began, so no
## squad listed earlier moves first and changes what a later one sees (Decision 97).
## Chasers and withdrawing units are left to ScrumPursuit and FormationWithdraw. Pure over
## the squads it is given.
