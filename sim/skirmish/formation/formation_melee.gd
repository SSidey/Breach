## This tick's melee blows (Decision 88): units in the scrum strike the foes they touch
## (ScrumBlows), and hostiles strike routers within reach from behind (RoutBlows).
## How each lands - high ground and flanks among what shifts it - is BlowLanding's.
## Pure over the squads it is given; FormationSimulation applies the blows.

## [[attacker, target, damage, flank], ...]; clears every living unit's target, then
## updates each striker's target and cooldown. `fight_seed` breaks ties between equal
## targets (Decision 97). Given the battle's native bodies (`field`, NativeKernels), the
## scrum's search runs on them (ScrumBlowsField).
