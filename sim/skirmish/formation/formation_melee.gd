## This tick's melee blows (Decision 88): units in the scrum strike the foes they touch
## (ScrumBlows), and hostiles strike routers within reach from behind (RoutBlows).
## How each lands - high ground and flanks among what shifts it - is BlowLanding's.
## Pure over the squads it is given; FormationSimulation applies the blows.
