class_name FormationCommand
extends RefCounted
## A command (spec 30 round 3, the user's model): the orders a formation was set up with -
## the route it takes as its guide, the end it calls home, and the wave's standing options
## (hurrying, tending its own wounded, merging, pursuing). A unit carries the command it
## follows and the one it started under; a squad is a group of one command's units
## standing together, and every group of a command follows its orders. Units taken in by
## another group follow that group's command from then on (enlist). Pure.
