class_name FormationWithdraw
extends RefCounted
## A withdrawal (Decision 99, spec 27 round 10): a retreat is how a formation deals with an
## enemy, as fighting is, so it shares combat's priority (FormationManoeuvre). Ordered to
## retreat out of a fight, it leaves from where its units stand - no walking back to their
## places first:
## - **Disengaging, then flight:** each unit turns for home and heads there along its
##   route. Disengaging is a manoeuvre whose efficacy its formation's discipline sets, as
##   re-forming is (Decisions 92 and 101): until clear of the foes it touches, a unit turns
##   at its turn rate, and steps away at its pace, times the re-form pace - a disciplined
##   formation breaks off quickly and cleanly, a ragged one slowly, backing off and exposed
##   (flank blows) while it turns. Once clear it is in flight, at its full pace. Until it
##   has turned, a unit still facing a foe it touches strikes it (ScrumBlows). The less
##   ordered the formation, the wider its units fan out from the route's line: up to
##   RoutFlight.FAN_DEGREES either side, by a seeded angle per unit, for one with no
##   discipline. Ground it can't cross holds it.
## - **Safe:** with no enemy within FormationRout.ENEMY_NEAR of it, and none pursuing it,
##   for FormationRout.RALLY_SECONDS - the test a rout rallies by - it re-forms on its route
##   where its units stand, facing home, and marches home (its order). One whose units are
##   all home, with nowhere further to go, re-forms there at once, facing out the way it
##   will hold, and fights as any other. Its units fan out no further than a rout's, by its
##   disorder.
## Squads keep `withdraw` ({"safe_ticks"}). Pure over the squads it is given.
