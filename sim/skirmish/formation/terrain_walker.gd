class_name TerrainWalker
extends RefCounted
## How a unit crosses terrain (spec 30, Decisions 64 and 85): its height, which sets the
## bands of liquid it wades, and its movement modes. Climbing and swimming follow one
## rule: the mode's base pace (BattleTuning) times Decision 64's pair rule, its ability
## (`climber N`, `swimmer N`; every unit has both at 0) against the ground's demand (a
## cliff's climb difficulty, water's `flows`). A unit loaded past the threshold uses
## neither mode; one that "sinks" never swims and one that "cant_climb" never climbs.
## FormationTerrain reads it for the pace of each step, so the march and paths can't
## disagree. Pure.
