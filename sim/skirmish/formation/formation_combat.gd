## How hard a blow lands, and ranged strikes, per specs/22-formation-feel-test.md and
## Decision 40. Pure: FormationSimulation calls it each tick.
##
## Ranged units (Decisions 46-47) strike with their best ranged weapon from anywhere in
## their squad, moving or fighting: the nearest enemy unit within its range in ranks,
## preferring one they overlap laterally, then by the seeded draw (Decision 97). A ranged
## unit in the front rank of an engaged squad strikes with its melee weapons instead.
