extends RefCounted
## The foes near a unit, found through a grid (BodyGrid) rather than by looking at every
## foe on the field (spec 30 round 3). An index is taken of [[unit, squad], ...] where they
## stand at that moment (ScrumReach); a search gives back the foes it could concern in the
## list's own order - every one that qualifies, and only some that don't - so whatever
## looks through them picks exactly as it would through the whole list (Decision 97).
## Pure; cells.
