class_name FormationPathing
extends RefCounted
## Groups find their way (spec 30 round 3, part 6b). A marching group looks along its route
## ahead (path_look cells) as its pathfinder sees it - the unit with the best wits
## (SquadPathfinder), its sight shaped and obscured (PathSight) - for the whole group as
## one walker: as tall as its tallest, swimming or climbing only if all of them can, at the
## least of their abilities. Where that stretch is barred, or much slower than a way round
## (path_detour_gain), it plans the way round (TerrainPaths.plan) and keeps it on its
## command as a patch to the route (RoutePatch): every group of the command follows the
## patched route from then on. It looks again only once its front has moved on
## (path_relook cells). Pure over the squads it is given.
