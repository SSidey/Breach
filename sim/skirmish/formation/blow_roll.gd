class_name BlowRoll
extends RefCounted
## How a blow lands (Decision 118, spec 28 part 4): one seeded roll (Decision 93), the
## striker's skill plus a roll about it, its margin read against the target's layers in
## the order the user gave - its parry (melee only, with a weapon or shield), then its
## dodge (its agility), then its defence, which a blow short of grazes - then a hit, and a
## margin past the hit band a critical (the striker's critical multiplier). High ground
## and being surrounded add to the margin, and morale shifts it by band; a blow from the
## target's flank finds no parry, one from its rear no dodge either. These replace the
## flank, high ground and morale multipliers on damage; what a blow deals is BlowDamage's.
## All numbers: BattleTuning. Pure.
