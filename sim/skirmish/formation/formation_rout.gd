class_name FormationRout
extends RefCounted
## Rout (Decision 82, spec 27 round 3): a panicked flight, not an orderly about-face.
## - **Breaking:** at 0 morale a formation routs. Every lock on it ends, and friends that
##   see it break take a little shock.
## - **Flight:** its units flee one by one back along its route towards home at full
##   speed, fanning out from it as they go (RoutFlight, Decision 99). They strike nothing;
##   a hostile unit in contact strikes them from behind (RoutBlows, flank blows).
## - **Crush:** a router running through a friend's cell hurts both (blunt, by its size),
##   and that friend's formation takes panic shock.
## - **Rally:** a router that reaches a friendly formation with a leader joins its rear
##   ranks. One that runs into any standing friendly formation (Decisions 89 and 98) is
##   caught there: it stops (shoving in among them, its body kept apart: UnitBodies),
##   and after a few seconds with that formation steady (BattleTuning) joins its rear,
##   walking to its place. A shaken formation holds its routers until it steadies.
##   A routing formation whose own leader lives, with no enemy near for a few seconds,
##   re-forms where its leader stands and holds there.
## - **Home:** routers that reach home leave the field ("fled_home"; the player's routers
##   go back to the reserve).
## Nothing hangs on list order (Decision 97): who breaks is decided before any breaks, so
## one break's shock can't cascade within the tick for squads listed later; every router
## flees, then every rally is decided, then they join; a router crushes or is caught by the
## nearest friend; ties go to the units' seeded draws (ScrumContest).
## A routing squad's `fleeing`: unit id -> {"along": cells along its route, "offset":
## its spread from the route}. Pure over the squads it is given.
