class_name FormationGroups
extends RefCounted
## Groups of a command splitting and forming up (spec 30 round 3, part 4; the user's model
## of formations as commands). A squad is a group of one command's units standing together.
## - **Splitting:** units fallen further behind their places than walk_lost - where the
##   frame doesn't wait for them (FormationWalk) - go on as a group of their own, of the
##   same command and its orders: one group for each cluster of them within group_join of
##   one another.
## - **Forming up:** two friendly groups out of a fight whose units come within group_join
##   of each other - of one command; or of different commands, both having fought and
##   either both standing or marching the same way along the same route - form up by one
##   rule:
##   - of one command, they are one group again: the larger takes in the other;
##   - otherwise each keeps its own orders, unless a leader's trait says otherwise: a
##     leader that "gathers" takes in a leaderless group it meets; a leader that "joins"
##     brings its group into the other's command;
##   - two leaderless groups merge only if either is set to merge, the one with more
##     cells' worth of units taking in the other;
##   - two led groups each keep their own, and units each started under the other's
##     command go back to it.
##   A group taken in is "merged" into the taker. Units taken in follow the taker's
##   command from then on (FormationCommand.enlist).
## Every meeting is decided from one snapshot, nearest first; ties in size go to the
## groups' seeded draws, never to ids or the order they are listed in (Decision 97). Pure.
