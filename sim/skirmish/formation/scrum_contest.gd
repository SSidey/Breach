## Who gets a contested cell in the scrum (Decision 88), and the seeded draws that settle
## any tie left once what things are and where they stand are equal (Decision 97). The
## order is the key (arrival time, roll + initiative, initiative, speed, unit's draw),
## compared item by item
## - the earliest arrival first, then the higher roll plus initiative, then the higher
## initiative, the faster unit, and last a seeded draw wide enough that it never ties in
## practice. The roll is the unit's seeded variance, drawn once per contest from the fight's
## seed, the tick and the unit, so a replay repeats. Pure.

## A squad's draw, as draw() is a unit's: for ties between whole formations - which foe a
