## What a rout's routers look for near them - friends to crush, catch or flee to, enemies
## near - found through grids (BodyGrid, ScrumNear) rather than by looking at every unit on
## the field (spec 30 round 3). One tick's `friends` = {"squads": [...]} gathers each
## faction's index the first time it is asked for, and keeps it the rest of the tick:
## - "crush": the units of a faction's squads not routing, at their positions;
## - "stand": the units of its standing squads, where their bodies are (ScrumReach).
## Those squads stand where they are through a tick of routs; a unit killed since (crushed)
## is passed over. Each search picks as a search of every unit in the list's order would:
## the nearest by the distance snapped to 0.000001, then by the units' seeded draws
## (Decision 97), worked out only on a tie. Pure; cells.
